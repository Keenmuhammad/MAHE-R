# Bartlett's sphericity
cortest.bartlett(food) #a statistical test in factor analysis used to determine the 
# correlation matrix of a set of a variable is significantly different from identity matrix
# Hypothesis of the test is that correlation matrix used is an identity matrix, alternate
#hypothesis states that correlation matrix is not an identity matrix. If p value in the 
#result is significant we reject the null hypothesis. if not significant we accept the 
#null hypothesis, if this is the case, the test assumes that the variabes are normally 
#distributed and have a linear relationship

# row SS loadings gives the sum of squared loadings. This is sometimes used to determine the value of a particular factor.
#A factor is worth keeping if the SS loading is greater than 1.

# Conventionally, we reject H0
#if the p-value is less than 0.05
# Such a result indicates that the number of factors is too small. In contrast, we do not reject H0
# if the p-value exceeds 0.05

# Uniqueness
#  The uniqueness, sometimes referred to as noise, corresponds to the proportion of variability, which can not be explained by a linear combination of the factors.

#A high uniqueness for a variable indicates that the factors do not account well for its variance. 
food.fa$uniquenesses

# Communalities
# By squaring the loading we compute the fraction of the variableâ€™s total variance explained by the factor
# This proportion of the variability is denoted as communality.
apply(food.fa$loadings^2,1,sum)

#Note, total variance is distributed among communalities and the uniqueness
#the major variance is represented as communalities & the noise 
#part is represented as uniqueness

# Another way to calculate the uniqueness is to subtract the Communalities from 1.
# An appropriate factor model results in low values for uniqueness and high values for communality.

# Now comes the tricky aspect in factor analysis: 
#Interpreting the factors themselves. 
#If two variables both have large loadings for the same factor, 
#then we know they have something in common. As a researcher we have to understand the data and its meaning in order to give a name to that common ground. 
#Taking a look on the figures above is appears that factor 1 accounts for pastry, which is dense and can be bend a lot before it breaks. Whereas factor 2 accounts for pastry that crispy and hard to break apart. 
#So if we need to names these factors we would probably call them soft pastry (factor 1) and hard pastry (factor 2)
